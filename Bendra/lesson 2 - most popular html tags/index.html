    <h1>Most popular HTML elements</h1>
    <p>
      There are many HTML elements (<em>also known as HTML tags</em>), but not all of them are commonly used.
      We will run through most common ones, and shortly describe what are their use cases.
    </p>
  </main>

  <section>
    <!-- We add font size for better representation, because it is artificialy reduced, when used more than once. -->
    <h1 style="font-size: 2em">1'st size heading</h1>
    <h2>2'nd size heading</h2>
    <h3>3'rd size heading</h3>
    <h4>4'th size heading</h4>
    <h5>5'th size heading</h5>
    <h6>6'th size heading</h6>
    <p>
      <strong>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</strong> tags are used for headings. The <strong>h1</strong> is the largest,
      and should be used to describe the main purpose of the page. For better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
      you should only use a single <strong>h1</strong> tag. <br><br> <!-- br: break-->

      <strong>h2 tags are mostly used for section naming.</strong><br>
      <strong>h3 tags are used for articles, posts and other page components headings</strong><br>
      <strong>h4 - h6 tags are sub-headers</strong><br><br>

      In page structure, heading tags should always be used ascendingly. You can't skip header size.
      Skipping a heading size, like : h1->h3 is a very bad practice, becouse SEO can't validate your page content
      properly.

    <h2>Most common block elements</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Block elements</strong> are mostly used as containers for other HTML elements. Their purpose is to suggest
      and describe content within them, most common are:
    <ul>
      <li>header - used for navbars, card headers, any block elements that represent the describing part of a component
      </li>
      <li>section - used to describe one of many page sections</li>
      <li>main - used for the main page section, which is the whole purpose of the page</li>
      <li>article - post, article, or any self contained component</li>
      <li>aside - used for sidebars, or any content which is on a side of a main page content</li>
      <li>footer - used for page footers. Footers are mostly used to contacts, copyrights and page links</li>
      <li>div - for any other purposes. This element has no special meaning. It is also a default HTML element</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>ul - unordered list</h3>
      <p>
        It is the most popular list. It is used for any general use lists. Although <strong>ul</strong> tag has some
        default
        styling, it is prefered by SEO to have common purpose components in a list. We can alter the style using CSS
        styles.
      </p>

    <article>
      <h3>ol - ordered list</h3>
      <p>
        You should use <strong>ol</strong> tag only when the order of list items are important. Same as for
        <strong>ul</strong>
        elements, you can change the style with CSS later.

      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>
        You can upload images to your page by using CSS, or using <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong>. When using
        <strong>img</strong> tag you have to set up several attributes;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>src - the path to the image which should be loaded</li>
        <li>alt - text, which will be shown if image is not found by the <strong>src</strong> attribute</li>
        <li>height - sets image height. Width is changed respectively by the image width to heigth ratio</li>
        <li>width - sets image width. Height is changed respectively by the image width to heigth ratio</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>IMPORTANT! </strong>If both, height and width is specified, then image could get streched
      <div>
        <h4>Using images by url path</h4>
